<strong>This project was carried out during a course on the Alura platform</strong>

I did the header with user interactivity.

I did the body with a gradient background and put a map with the location of google Maps.

I created a list with the benefits, highlighting the first element, and put a video directly from Youtube.

I added at the end the footer with the logo and a gray background.

In addition to user interactivity in the project, the pages are also responsive.

Finally, it includes a contact page with a form for sending and a table with opening hours.
